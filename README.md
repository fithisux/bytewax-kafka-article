This is based on the presentation [Streaming Sales Generator](https://github.com/garystafford/streaming-sales-generator/tree/main).

The KStreams demo is ported to Bytewax and verified with ksqlDB.
The sales generator is refactored and its business logic made explicit.

There is a Medium article.  [Porting a KStreams demo to Bytewax](https://fithis2001.medium.com/porting-a-kstreams-demo-to-bytewax-a7de90e70e45)
